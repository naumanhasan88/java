Here are ten array-related practice questions along with their descriptions. These questions cover various aspects of arrays, including basic operations, searching, sorting, and manipulation:

1. **Reverse an Array**:
   Write a program to reverse the elements of an array in-place.

2. **Find the Maximum and Minimum Element**:
   Write a program to find the maximum and minimum elements in an array.

3. **Find the Second Largest Element**:
   Write a program to find the second largest element in an array.

4. **Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array**:
   Write a program to remove duplicates from a sorted array in-place.

5. **Rotate Array**:
   Write a program to rotate the elements of an array to the right by k steps.

6. **Check for Palindrome Array**:
   Write a program to check if an array is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).

7. **Merge Two Sorted Arrays**:
   Write a program to merge two sorted arrays into a single sorted array.

8. **Find Missing Number**:
   Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n, find the one that is missing from the array.

9. **Find Peak Element**:
   Write a program to find a peak element in an array. A peak element is an element that is greater than its neighbors.

10. **Subarray with Given Sum**:
    Given an unsorted array of non-negative integers, find a continuous subarray that adds up to a given sum.

These questions should cover a range of difficulty levels and help you practice different array-related concepts. You can find solutions to these problems on various coding platforms or websites dedicated to programming practice. Let me know if you need further assistance with any of these questions!
