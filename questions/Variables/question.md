**Variables:**
1. Declare a variable to store an integer named "num."
   - This program involves declaring an integer variable named "num" without assigning it any specific value.

2. Create a string variable named "name" and assign it your name.
   - This program declares a string variable named "name" and assigns it the value of your name.

3. Perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication) using two variables.
   - In this program, you'll declare two variables, perform addition, subtraction, and multiplication operations, and display the results.

4. Swap the values of two variables without using a third variable.
   - The goal here is to exchange the values of two variables without introducing a third variable.

5. Use a boolean variable to represent whether it's raining or not.
   - Declare a boolean variable that represents the weather condition (true for raining, false for not raining).

6. Convert a string to an integer and vice versa.
   - Write a program that converts a string to an integer and vice versa, showcasing conversion techniques.

7. Declare and initialize a constant variable.
   - This program demonstrates how to declare and initialize a constant variable with a fixed value.

8. Explain the difference between int and double data types.
   - The program should highlight the distinctions between the int and double data types in Java.

9. Concatenate two strings in Java.
   - This program involves concatenating (joining) two strings together in Java.

10. Use the += operator to update a variable's value.
    - Demonstrate the use of the += operator to update the value of a variable.
